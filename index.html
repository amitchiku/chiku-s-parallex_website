          For over 24 years, editors have volunteered their time and talents to
          create history's most comprehensive encyclopedia while providing
          references and other resources to researchers worldwide (see
          Researching with Wikipedia). In summary, Wikipedia has tested the
          wisdom of the crowd since 2001 and has found that it succeeds.

          Wikipedia differs from printed references in important ways. Anyone
          can instantly improve it, add quality information, remove
          misinformation, and fix errors and vandalism. Since Wikipedia is
          continually updated, encyclopedic articles on major news events appear
          within minutes.
